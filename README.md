https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/python_install

## Jupyter Notebook
Please refer to the /notebook folder

The folder contains one jupyter notebook file and some .html files which are for those interactive maps.

All scripts are in the jupyter notebook
### Note:
Chrome has limitations on rendering large interactive maps, so large maps were saved seperately. Please run the corresponding cell to load the map or uncomment the corresponding script to generate maps and save them as html


## Cleaned Data for Analysis
Please refer to the /saved_data folder
### Note:
This is a long notebook, so several .csv containing cleaned data were generated. Please uncomment the corresponding script to generate those datasets.
